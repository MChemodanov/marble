* The method measureTool() has been moved from MarbleMap to MarbleModel.
  You can continue accessing the measure tool from MarbleMap using MarbleMap::model()->measureTool().

* The method ViewParams *viewParams() has been removed from MarbleMap in favor of ViewportParams *viewport().
  Setting and getting the MapQuality can now be done using MarbleMap::setMapQuality() and MarbleMap::mapQuality().
  Access to the current AbstractProjection is still possible using MarbleMap::viewport()->currentProjection().
  MarbleMap::viewParams()->propertyAvailable() can now be reached under MarbleMap::model()->mapTheme()->settings()->propertyAvailable().
  The canvas and coast images are not accessible any longer by inention. Use MarbleMap::mapScreenShot() to access the resulting map, or implement a plugin to draw onto the map.

* Introduce MarbleWidget::viewport().
  Use MarbleWidget::viewport() rather than MarbleWidget::map()->viewport().
  Use MarbleWidget::viewport()->mapCoversViewport() rahter than MarbleWidget::map()->mapCoversViewport().

* From MarbleWidget remove setProxy(), proxyHost(), proxyPort(), user(), password().
  These methods haven't been meaningful to MarbleWidget and have been commented to be removed a long time ago.

* RenderPlugin::pluginInstance() has been renamed RenderPlugin::newInstance to be consistent with other plugin types.
  You only need to change your code if you're not using the MARBLE_PLUGIN macro in custom RenderPlugins.

* Remove MarbleMap::zoom{In, Out}().
  For applications using MarbleWidget, using its zoomIn() and zoomOut() slots is preferred.
  For applications that need to operate on MarbleMap directly, there is still MarbleMap::zoomViewBy( zoomAmount ).

* Remove MarbleMap::moveStep() and MarbleMap::move{Left, Right, Up, Down}().
  For applications using MarbleWidget, using its corresponding methods and slots is preferred.
  For applications that need to operate on MarbleMap directly, use MarbleMap::rotateBy( ... ). See MarbleWidgetPrivate::moveByStep() for an example.

* Remove Marble{Map, Widget}::{north,south}PolePosition().
  Use Marble{Map, Widget}::screenCoordinates( 0.0, poleLat, ... ) instead, where poleLat is +90 for the north pole and -90 for the south pole.
  Feel free to request constants like Marble::NorthPole and Marble::SouthPole if you use the screen coordinates of the poles in your application.

* Remove or make private Marble{Map, Widget}::{needsUpdate(), setNeedsUpdate(), updateChangedMap()}.
  There is no need to call these methods any more since they are invoked internally when needed.
  It should be safe to remove any code that calls these methods from outside MarbleMap/MarbleWidget.
