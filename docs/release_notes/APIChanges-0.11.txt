* The method measureTool() has been moved from MarbleMap to MarbleModel.
  You can continue accessing the measure tool from MarbleMap using MarbleMap::model()->measureTool().

* The method ViewParams *viewParams() has been removed from MarbleMap in favor of ViewportParams *viewport().
  Setting and getting the MapQuality can now be done using MarbleMap::setMapQuality() and MarbleMap::mapQuality().
  Access to the current AbstractProjection is still possible using MarbleMap::viewport()->currentProjection().
  MarbleMap::viewParams()->propertyAvailable() can now be reached under MarbleMap::model()->mapTheme()->settings()->propertyAvailable().
  The canvas and coast images are not accessible any longer by inention. Use MarbleMap::mapScreenShot() to access the resulting map, or implement a plugin to draw onto the map.

* Introduce MarbleWidget::viewport().
  Use MarbleWidget::viewport() rather than MarbleWidget::map()->viewport().
  Use MarbleWidget::viewport()->mapCoversViewport() rahter than MarbleWidget::map()->mapCoversViewport().

* From MarbleWidget remove setProxy(), proxyHost(), proxyPort(), user(), password().
  These methods haven't been meaningful to MarbleWidget and have been commented to be removed a long time ago.

* Move MarbleMap::home(...) and MarbleMap::setHome(...) to MarbleModel.

* Remove MarbleMap::goHome().
  Use MarbleMap::flyTo(home), where home is the home position.

* RenderPlugin::pluginInstance() has been renamed RenderPlugin::newInstance to be consistent with other plugin types.
  You only need to change your code if you're not using the MARBLE_PLUGIN macro in custom RenderPlugins.
