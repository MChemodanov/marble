    \class StackedTile
    \brief A single tile that is composed one or more different tile layers.

    The StackedTile is a tile that covers a certain area and is used 
    for a particular zoom level. It consists of a <b>stack of several
    individual thematic TextureTiles</b> that cover the very same area and 
    are used for the very same zoom level: This stack of TextureTiles is
    built up from the ground: The first TextureTile at the bottom usually 
    represents the ground surface. Optionally there might be a range of other
    TextureTiles stacked on top which cover e.g. relief, streets and clouds.
    
    For rendering the whole stack of tiles gets merged and blended into a 
    single QImage. This merging/blending operation is usually only performed 
    once the stack of tiles changes. As a result access to the visual 
    composition of all TextureTile layers is very fast since it is reduced to 
    a single QImage that also covers very little memory.

    The whole mechanism is comparable to layers in applications like
    Gimp or Photoshop (TM) which can be blended on top of each other via 
    so called filters and can be merged into a single layer if required.

    Restrictions: The TextureTiles that are part of the stack need to be of 
    the same size and need to cover the same area at the same zoom level using 
    the very same projection.
